An MP has had more than Â£600 and his passport stolen after being mugged by six men in a park in Kenya.
Mr Davies, 60, said the mugging occurred 100 yards from the Nairobi Serena Hotel and equally close to the Anglican Cathedral in the centre of the city at dusk.
"Two of them held me from behind and two others held my legs and another one expertly rifled all my pockets."
