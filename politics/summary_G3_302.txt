George Galloway is to stand against pro-Iraq war Labour MP Oona King at the next general election.
Mr Galloway's current constituency is set to disappear under planned boundary changes in Scotland.
Speaking from a cafe in Brick Lane, east London, Mr Galloway said he had accepted the party's invitation to stand with "great honour and pride".
