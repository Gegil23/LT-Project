British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.
Ballot papers in the poll will ask: "Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?"
The treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum.
